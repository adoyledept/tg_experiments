# Account Initialization Infrastructure

## _Placeholder until required resources identified_

This module creates the minimum required resources to initialize a new AWS account to accept further configuration.

This includes, for example, an IAM role for GitHub access, an IAM role for Terraform, and an S3 bucket for state management.
